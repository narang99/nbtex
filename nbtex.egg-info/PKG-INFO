Description: # NbTex  
        
        A light-weight pythonic wrapper around LaTeX specifically to python-like interface to write mathemical latex in Jupyter Notebooks.   
        **NOTE:** Only Jupyter Notebooks are supported. Tests done in notebooks too
        
        You can create latex for:
        
        + `+`: Adding
        + `-`: Subtraction
        + `*`: Multiplication
        + `pow`: Exponents
        + `^`: Exponents (another way)
        + `/`: Fractions
        + `|`: Space in generated latex
        + `()`: Function calling with arbitrary args
        + `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`: Ordering operators
        + `==`, `!=`: Equal and Not Equal
        + `~`: Inversion of the topmost operator in the expression (eg: ~(x*y) will give LaTeX for division/fraction)
        + Matrices
        + Differentiation
        + Partial Differentiation
        + Integration
        + Integration over partials
        + Summation
        + Product
        + Vector notation
        
        ## Usage  
        The usage is best presented by examples  
        Look at the [docs](https://github.com/narang99/nbtex/tree/master/docs)   
        **NOTE:** Jupyter Notebooks uploaded on github are making the rendered latex slightly weird. The generation in a normal notebook seems to be absolutely normal
