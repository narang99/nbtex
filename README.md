# Pytex  

A light-weight pythonic wrapper around LaTeX specifically to provide python-like interface to write mathemical latex in Jupyter Notebooks.   
**NOTE:** Only Jupyter Notebooks are supported for now. Tests done in notebooks too

## Usage  
The usage is best presented by examples  
Look at the docs/ for examples.  
**NOTE:** Jupyter Notebooks uploaded on github are making the rendered latex slightly weird. The generation in a normal notebook seems to be absolutely normal
